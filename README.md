Drone legislation and AI

## Data
Using `scripts/download_xml_extract_txt.py` passing as an argument the link of the `xml` of a legislation, you can download the `xml` page and also extract its main content as `txt`. Note that some decisions have been made when extracting the text which are documented in the code.
